The first circle to appear will be NY.  It will enter as a meteor strike and then increase it's radius with a line being drawn out to it's city name. Then the rest of the circles will enter as either:
  - meteors with short delays between enter
  -lines originating from NY to other city location with circle being drawn once the line reaches destination.

Courses Tab:

States will be colored one stardard color on inital load if they contain a class

Hovering over the state will then show a circle that grows in radius to show the number of classes avaialble at that location with a line drawn from circle to it's city name

Hovering over the class will highlight those states in which those classes are being offered and enable the circles

Hovering over a circle will show a tooltip with additional info..what info?
