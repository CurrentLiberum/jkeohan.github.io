			//Logic
			//map gets drawn on first render
			//then transitions into diff projection
			//-tranistion will occur on path being updated to new projection and then applying them to all paths


			//what functions are needed?
			//init(), render()

			//init should include:
			//svg, colors, canvasSize, d3.json, .data().enter().append(path)

			//render() should include:
			//projection
			//all path elements and attr(d,path)
			
			//what has to be defined first?
			//svg, colors, canvas
